                  Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

                <h3>About The Legend</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                       At the request of Gopal Krishna Gokhale, conveyed to him by C. F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[4][5] was born on 2 October 1869[6] into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family[7][8] in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. 
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.[9][10] His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.[1
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Although he only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, Karamchand proved a capable chief minister.[12] During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        n 1857, he sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from Junagadh,[12] and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family.[13] Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).[14][15]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about.
                    </li>
                    <li> One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."[16] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he states that they left an indelible impression on his mind.
                    </li>
                    <li>
He writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.
